            <h3>
                Gender inequality and the climate crisis are two of the most urgent challenges of today. As we better
                understand and make the critical connections between gender, social equity and climate change, it’s time
                we take action towards solutions.
                <br>
                Globally, women have fewer opportunities for economic participation than men, less access to basic and
                higher education, greater health and safety risks, and less political representation.
                <br>
                Guaranteeing the rights of women and giving them opportunities to reach their full potential is critical
                not only for attaining gender equality, but also for meeting a wide range of international development
                goals. Empowered women and girls contribute to the health and productivity of their families,
                communities, and countries, creating a ripple effect that benefits everyone.
                <br>
                The word gender describes the socially-constructed roles and responsibilities that societies consider
                appropriate for men and women. Gender equality means that men and women have equal power and equal
                opportunities for financial independence, education, and personal development. Women's empowerment is a
                critical aspect of achieving gender equality.

            <h3>Over the last few decades, 55 per cent of the improvement in food security in developing countries has
                been driven by programmes promoting women's empowerment. The Food and Agriculture Organization projects
                that if women farmers had equal access to productive resources, their farm yields would increase by 20
                to 30 per cent. This could provide enough food to keep 100 to 150 million people from going hungry,
                reducing global hunger by 12 to 17 per cent.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>
                Increasing the productive capacity of women smallholders (small-scale farmers who manage agricultural
                areas up to 10 hectares, or roughly 25 acres) also helps to promote sustainable agricultural practices.
                75 per cent of the world's food comes from only 12 plants and 5 animal species, making the global food
                system extremely vulnerable to environmental shocks -- such as changing climate patterns and extreme
                weather events.

                The global economy depends on the unpaid and underpaid care work primarily carried out by women. But
                despite its essential nature -- which we've seen more than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic –– this
                work is not valued in accordance with its worth. Rather, care work (much like the environment) is
                treated like a limitless commodity that can be used without cost or consequence.
                <br>
                Instead, governments should treat care work like a collective good, expanding its availability and
                providing adequate support to those who do it. This includes investing in the expansion of care
                services, as well as increasing support for unpaid caregivers There's a role for the private sector as
                well, in supporting unpaid care work through paid family leave and flexible working arrangements.
                Investing in care work is not only an acknowledgement of its importance but is also a way to create jobs
                and foster economic growth without increasing carbon emissions.

                At both the national and the community level, women’s representation and leadership appear to drive
                better environmental outcomes. Countries with higher percentages of women in parliament tend to adopt
                stricter climate change policies, resulting in lower emissions. At the local level, women’s
                participation in managing natural resources leads to more equitable and inclusive resource governance
                and better conservation outcomes. And when community climate programmes fully include women, they tend
                to be more effective and efficient in their use of resources.

                Strong civil society organizations are a critical counterbalance to powerful state and corporate actors.
                They bring the voices of those who best understand their own experiences and needs into decision-making
                processes and help to keep governments accountable to the people they are meant to serve -- both key to
                climate action that prioritizes the wellbeing of people and planet.
                <br>
                Government collaboration with women's organizations can help ensure that climate policies meet the
                specific needs of women and girls, and that such policies are effectively implemented. In vulnerable
                communities, women's organizations often act as an informal safety net, bridging gaps in government
                services and helping to provide emergency support. Empowering such community networks is a crucial way
                to build climate resilience at the local level.

                Evidence suggests that women will bear the brunt of climate-linked negative health outcomes. In general,
                women are more likely to die in disasters, due in part to their limited access to resources and
                services. Research also indicates that climate change will have negative sexual and reproductive health
                impacts: higher temperatures are increasing the spread of diseases like malaria, dengue fever and Zika
                virus, which are linked to negative pregnancy and birth outcomes, and extreme heat itself appears to
                increase the incidence of stillbirth. As with other crises and disasters, climate change also increases
                vulnerability to gender-based violence.
                <br>
                At the same time, climate disasters often pull resources away from women's health services and services
                to support survivors of gender-based violence. As climate change worsens, it is critical that these
                services are strengthened and expanded to help keep women healthy and safe.
